# LinkifyApp
A simple app to interact with my Linkify server

TODO:
```
Make the client look a lot nicer. It is literally just a basic Form1 right now and thats lame.
Storing tokens. Right now, the server is storing the token in the cache. I don't quite like this, it probably isn't very efficient.
Allow user to create song pairings on the app, as well as handling initial log-in steps.
